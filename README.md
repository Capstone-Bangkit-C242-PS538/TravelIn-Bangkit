Here is our repository for the Bangkit 2024 Capstone project - Mobile Development.

## DESCRIPTION
building a native Android app using Kotlin in Android Studio, with a simple UI/UX that we design using Figma. The app allows users to select travel preferences, such as nature or culture, through a form we provide, then displays destination recommendations according to those preferences using RecyclerView. The recommendation data is retrieved from the backend using Retrofit.
